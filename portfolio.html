                                    <p>The user can also create their own 3D simulations to better understand
                                        orbital mechanics and how they affect celestial bodies. </p>
                                    <p>Each planet the user chooses to
                                        add can have its: radius, mass, texture, atmosphere, day length, tidal locking
                                        and orbital eccentricity adjusted as well as the option to add a moon to them;
                                        the user can also then set the position of each planet (relative to the star)
                                        giving them free reign on how they set up their simulation.</p>
                                    <p>Custom backgrounds and textures can be uploaded to personalise the user's
                                        simulation even more.</p>

                                    <p>A desktop-based typing game which aims to improve both the vocabulary and typing
                                        speed of the user.</p>
                                    <p>The aim of the game is simple: type the word you see on the screen as quickly as
                                        possible. The user is shown 12 words and is rewarded with in-game currency based
                                        on their time taken. This currency is used to unlock new word sets in the
                                        game.</p>
                                    <p>In singleplayer, earn coins and set the best times you can to earn a top spot on
                                        the leaderboards, yielding bonus rewards.</p>
                                    <p>The multiplayer puts you up against another player in a head-to-head with the
                                        winner reaping all the rewards - the loser gets nothing. There are no skips so
                                        type accurately.</p>

                                    <p>A python program which is able to play a perfect game of Tetris, playing forever
                                        until reaching the maximum allowed score.</p>
                                    <p>For each Tetromino the current game context is analysed and then all possible
                                        moves for a Tetromino on separate game clones are tried. Each move is then
                                        scored based off pre-defined criteria. The highest scoring move is then applied
                                        to the real game.</p>
                                    <p>To improve the success rate of the AI, it also looks ahead to the next block
                                        (shown in the top right) and plays with it in another game clone. The
                                        highest-scoring move for both the current and lookahead block are then
                                        applied.</p>
                                    <p>A more detailed explanation of the AI is available on the GitHub page</p>

                                    <p>A program which is able to play a game of 2048, with it reaching the target score
                                        2048 being guaranteed.</p>
                                    <p>In the same vein as the Tetris AI (previous slide), it works by trying all
                                        possible moves for a given block on a clone of the game scores them based on
                                        pre-defined criteria. The highest-scoring move is then chosen to play with.</p>
                                    <p>A more detailed explanation of the inner workings of the AI is available on
